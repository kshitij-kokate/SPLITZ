You are tasked with building a production-ready RESTful backend service—the “Split App”—that enables groups to track shared expenses and automatically compute fair settlements, akin to Splitwise or Google Pay’s bill-splitting feature. Follow every requirement below precisely. 

1. Core Functionality
Expense Tracking

POST /expenses

Request body:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "amount": <positive number>,
  "description": "<non-empty string>",
  "paid_by": "<person name>"
}
Auto-create the person if not already present.

Support splitting with equal share (default); design extensibly for exact or percentage splits.

GET /expenses

Returns list of all expenses with id, amount, description, paid_by, split_method, and timestamp.

PUT /expenses/:id

Update any of amount, description, paid_by, or split details.

DELETE /expenses/:id

Remove the expense; recalculate balances accordingly.

Settlement Calculations

GET /people

Lists every person (derived from expenses), with unique IDs and names.

GET /balances

For each person, return { name, total_paid, fair_share, balance } where balance = total_paid – fair_share.

GET /settlements

Compute a minimal set of transactions to settle all balances.

Response format example:

json
Copy
Edit
[
  { "from": "Alice", "to": "Bob",   "amount": 25.00 },
  { "from": "Charlie","to": "Alice","amount": 10.00 }
]
Data Validation & Error Handling

Input Validation:

amount must be > 0.

description and paid_by are required, non-empty strings.

Edge Cases:

Return 400 Bad Request with clear JSON errors for invalid input.

404 Not Found for updates/deletes on non-existent resources.

GET /balances or /settlements with zero expenses should return empty lists, not errors.

Uniform response envelope:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "success": <true|false>,
  "data": <object|array|null>,
  "message": "<informative string>"
}
2. Optional (Extra Credit)
Implement any or all of these for bonus points—core functionality must be flawless first:

Recurring Transactions: auto-create periodic expenses (rent, subscriptions) at specified intervals.

Categories: allow tagging each expense with one of [Food, Travel, Utilities, Entertainment, Other] and support category‐wise totals.

Analytics Endpoints:

GET /monthly-summary – total spent per month.

GET /category-breakdown – spend per category per person.

Web Interface: simple HTML/JS UI to add expenses and view current balances/settlements.

3. Deliverables & Deployment
Code Repository

Public GitHub repo with clear README: setup steps, environment variables, database migrations/schema.

Clean, well-documented code (comments, meaningful function names).

Deployment

Deploy to a free-tier cloud service (e.g. Railway.app, Render.com).

Use a cloud database (PostgreSQL on Railway or MongoDB Atlas).

All endpoints must be live and publicly accessible.

Postman Collection

Create a public GitHub Gist hosting a Postman collection JSON.

Include:

All core endpoints with realistic sample data (“Shantanu”, “Sanket”, “Om”).

Pre-populated expenses demonstrating diverse scenarios (adding, updating, deleting).

Examples for invalid requests (negative amount, missing fields).

Ensure collection uses your deployed base URL.

Documentation

README:

API endpoint list with request/response examples.

Explanation of your settlement calculation algorithm.

Known limitations or assumptions.

(Optional) Short demo video or GIF illustrating key flows.

4. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
Incorrect Logic: equal-split vs exact/percentage miscalculations; floating-point rounding errors.

Validation Gaps: allowing negative amounts, silent failures on missing fields.

Inconsistent API: mismatched response formats or status codes.

Deployment Errors: hard-coded localhost URLs; unpopulated environments; database only local.

5. Recommended Tech Stack
Language/Framework: Node.js (Express), Python (FastAPI/Flask), or Java (Spring Boot)

Database: PostgreSQL (Railway) or MongoDB Atlas

CI/CD: GitHub Actions (for tests & deploy)

Testing: Postman for API; Jest/PyTest for unit logic.

Focus on:

Core features (expense tracking, settlements) 100% correct

Robust validation, clear errors, and consistent API design

Automated deployment & ready-to-run Postman collection
